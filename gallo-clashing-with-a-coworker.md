## Steps to Analyze a Conflict
* Counterpart
* Type of Conflict
* Goal
* Option

## Counterpart

### Avoider
* Value relationships, harmony
* Often placate
* Change topic
Or if they start to change the topic, I need to understand that's part of their avoider-ness, not because they're being disrespectful to me.

### Seeker
* Value directness, honesty
* Advocate for themselves, usually others as well
* Can be impatient

### Both
* Lots of people are both avoiders and seekers.
* You might be an avoider with your boss, but a seeker with your mother.
* We often use different tactics with a default one.

## Type of Conflict

### Relationship (aka Personal)
**Example**
* You feel disrespected
* You feel that your relationship is at stake (common for avoiders)

### Task (aka What)
* A type of conflict about a **goal** or **objective**.
* The most comment type of conflict.

**Example**
* To improve customer service or to increase revenue is the goal with our project.

### Process (aka How)
* A type of conflict on how to get to a goal.

### Status
* A type of conflict really about power or authority.

**Example**
* Jockeying for positions or authority in cross-functional teams
* turf wars.

Analyze and tease apart the different strings of your conflict.

Most conflicts (especially at work) don't necessarily start as a relationship conflict. More often, it starts as one of the others (task, process, or status) and ends up in a relationship conflict.

## Goal

### Find an appropriate goal
**Too Vague**
* "I want to win a conflict."

**Precise Enough**
* "The project needs to get done on time."
* "The product needs to come under budget."
* "Have a strong working relationship with the person who you're having a conflict with."

### Make sure your goal is a shared goal.
Find and work on the overlap of goals between yours and your counterpart's.

## Options

### Do nothing
* Sounds funny but very common.

**Good**
* If you're very concerned about the relationship.
* If you're dealing with someone who tends to be unreasonable.
* If you feel like they won't be open to have a conversation.

**Not Good**
* If you think that you're gonna stew about the situation.

### Directly Address
* Most often in American work culture

### Indirectly Address
* Very useful option in many cultures, contexts, organizations

### Exit Relationship
* This should be a last resort option.
* Often not possible in work culture.

But if you've tried one or more of these options, hopefully all of them, and things are not getting better, then you should definitely think about "how can I lessen my interaction with this person". Can I get staffed to a new team? Can I maybe, you know, switch departments and report to a new boss? You know, you don't need to stay in a situation where you're having a lot of conflicts and it really feels unresolvable.

There's very good reasons to have healthy conflict on a team. And that's actually a manager's responsibility to create some of that conflict, as long as it's healthy, as long as teams have the tools they need to work through a productive way.
